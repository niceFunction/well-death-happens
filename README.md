**Well, Death Happens** is a 2D Platformer inspired by "[Super Meat Boy](https://store.steampowered.com/app/40800/Super_Meat_Boy/)" & "[Prinny: Can I Really Be the Hero?](https://disgaea.fandom.com/wiki/Prinny:_Can_I_Really_Be_the_Hero%3F)" & was made in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) & [GDscript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html).

It was mainly made by me, [Samuel Einheri](https://www.samueleinheri.com/about).

### **About**
The goal of **Well, Death Happens** was to ask: "*How can Death in a game be more useful?*", and that resulted in this project. The Player will encounter levels where they have to think about how & where they die since the **Core Mechanic** of the game is that when the Player dies, it creates a resource called "**Corpse**".

These "**Corpses**" are created upon when the Player either, a **Spike** or a **Hole**. When the "**Corpse**" is created, it will fall straight down unless the Player dies on the ground.
The Player can then use these "**Corpses**" as Platforms to get across hazardous parts of different levels. But the Player starts with a limited amount of "**Corpses**" & if the amount of "**Corpses**" reaches 0, the game is over.

### **Controls**
- **Move to the Left:** A / Left Arrow Key or Use the Left Joystick on a Controller.
- **Move to the Right:** D / Right Arrow Key or Use the Left Joystick on a Controller.
- **Jump:** Space or the A-button (Xbox Controller).

### **Missing Features or Known Issues**
- No proper _Settings Menu_ or _Pause menu_.
- **Main-**, **Game Over-**, & **Thanks for Playing Menues** are implemented but very rudimentary.
- Except for the **Main-**, **Game Over-**, & **Thanks for Playing Menues**, while playing, you can't exit the game, you have to use **ALT+F4** to forcefully exit the game while playing.
- Movement at the moment is *kind of* snappy & can be challenging to control.
- The game was playtested using the **Keyboard** for a majority of the time, it isn't known how *well* the game plays with a **Controller**.
- **Coyote time** & **Jump Delay** needs fine tuning.
- When sliding down walls & sliding across "**WallBlocks**", the Player _may_ slowly float down ward in the middle of the air.
- No _background music_.
- **Jump SFX** _may_ play at points when it shouldn't play.
- No Visual Effects other than the **CRT shader effect**.
